# CSE327-Computer-Vision

HW1: Basic image processing with Gaussian, Median Filters and Edge Detectors

HW2: Using SIFT features to detect keypoints in images, basic image classification with SVMs (Support Vector Machines)

HW3: Math of perspective projections, camera callibration, using SIFT features to stitch images together

HW4: More image classification with Bag of Sift Features, Nearest Neighbor Classifiers, one-vs-all SVMs

HW5: Deep Learning, building a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) from scratch vs finetuning a pretrained CNN vs transfer learning with SVMs

HW6: Action Recogntion using pretrained CNN and custom made LSTM-RNN (Long Short Term Memory Reccurent Neural Network)
